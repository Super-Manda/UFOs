## :star: Overview of the analysis: :star:

### 
The purpose of the UFO Finder web page is to create a dynamic table that will offer a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. These criteria include: date, city, state, country, and shape.  To make the page more visually alluring to UFO searchers, the phrase "UFO SIGHTINGS: FACT OR FANCY?" is color-animated.  The user can browse this web page in the hopes of arriving at their own conclusion on the veracity of UFO claims in the United States and Canada.

### 
**Description of how to perform a search:**

**When accessing the page, this search box will appear with "default text" that shows how to enter the proper case and format that the search box will accept:**

![Main_Page](https://github.com/Super-Manda/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Whole%20Page.png)

**From there, the user could plug in the state in lowercase, such as "nj," which would yield 3 results.**

![NJ_UFOs](https://github.com/Super-Manda/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/NJ%20UFOs.png)


**After that, the user could then plug in an additional search, such as "nj" UFOs seen on the date of "1/5/2010," which would leave only 2 results.**

![NJ_UFOs_on_1-5-2010](https://github.com/Super-Manda/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/NJ%20UFOs%20on%201-5-2010.png) 

This is an example of how one or more criteria could be used, but there are any number of permutations that the user could enter.


## :star: Summary: :star:

- **There are several drawbacks of this webpage including that:**
  - there is no sorting function, such as sorting the durations from highest to lowest duration;  
  - likewise, the date function provides no range, so the user would have to do about 30 searches to get a list of every UFO on every day in a common month rather than just doing one search to look at something like “January 2010”;
  - some of the shape names are esoteric, such as “cigar,” so someone could be searching for an oval or cylinder and not pick up everything similar;
  - the case has to be exact in the search and it does not account for common user mishaps, such as poor spelling;
  - the comments section is not searchable.


- **Therefore, two main recommendations for further development are that**

  - the search box should be able to accept ranges rather than a hard-coded number or date in the future, and that, 
  - if the search box cannot have ranges, then a sorting function would be helpful.

In addition, this web page is more of a proof of concept than an exhaustive database on UFOs.  This page could be enhanced with more records, but for now, it provides enough information to be entertaining and informative.  :smile:
